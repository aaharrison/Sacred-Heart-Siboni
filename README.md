Assess building performance related to physical, environmental and cultural characteristics of the school including time of day, weather characteristics, and occupancy levels to develop conceptual strategies for addressing performance gaps

Phases

1)	Discovery – Collect building information such as thermal quality, lighting quality, sound quality, air quality and energy use at selected locations

2)	Assessment – Assess building performance related to physical, environmental and cultural characteristics of the school including time of day, weather characteristics, and occupancy levels

3)	Recommendations – Develop conceptual strategies for addressing performance gaps

Scope

•	Execution Period – 2-3 months

•	Study Period – 2 weeks in the summer and 2 weeks in the beginning of the school year

•	Locations – 10-12 spaces within the Siboni Building including 1 sensor on each floor, the theater, a couple on the second floor

Study Questions

1)	How is the building performing across selected performance measures?
    a.	Compare measured performance across time, to top performers across the building and selected standards
    
2)	How does performance relate to corresponding resource use?
    a.	Is performance higher/lower/same with increased energy use
    
3)	How well does that performance harness naturally available environmental resources?
    a.	How often are interior lights on when the room can be naturally day lit?
    
    b.	How often is HVAC on when outdoor conditions provide adequate thermal quality?

    c.	How often is Air Quality worse than ambient air quality?
